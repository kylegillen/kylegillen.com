How to update your blog post

# Nested Routes

The blog template supports posts in nested sub-folders. This helps in organisation and can be used to group posts of similar content e.g. a multi-part series. This post is itself an example of a nested route! It's located in the `/data/blog/nested-route` folder.

## How

Simplify create multiple folders inside the main `/data/blog` folder and add your `.md`/`.mdx` files to them. You can even create something like `/data/blog/nested-route/deeply-nested-route/my-post.md`

We use Next.js catch all routes to handle the routing and path creations.

## Use Cases

Here are some reasons to use nested routes

- More logical content organisation (blogs will still be displayed based on the created date)
- Multi-part posts
- Different sub-routes for each author
- Internationalization (though it would be recommended to use [Next.js built-in i8n routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing))

## Note

- The previous/next post links at bottom of the template are currently sorted by date. One could explore modifying the template to refer the reader to the previous/next post in the series, rather than by date.
